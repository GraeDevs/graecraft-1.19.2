# Graecraft for 1.19.2
Welcome to Graecraft! This repository is open-sourced to anyone needing resources for learning Minecraft Modding.

If you wish to experience this mod, currently it's a closed WIP. I'm the sole developer with no outside resource / helping hand, purely doing this
entirely by hobby and enjoyment for Minecraft. When it comes time, i'll make a Minecraft Forums post, a discord, and a CurseForge page.

This Mod requires the use of FABRIC and GECKOLIB. Without, this mod will not work.

The Content within this mod is random, with no centralized theme. Due to this nature, this mod may or may not be for your liking, but please do look around to see if 
it's up your alley.

This item / mod is no authorized for posting on CurseForge or Minecraft Forums, except under the name GraeDevs or Renk.
